            <h3>Game Objective</h3>
            <p>The objective of the Roll a Dice game is to accumulate a target score before your opponent does. The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.</p>

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>

                <li>Two players take turns rolling a six-sided dice.</li>
                <li>The current player's dice roll value is added to their round score.</li>
                <li>If the dice roll value is equal to 1, the player's round score becomes 0, and their turn ends.</li>
                <li>The player can choose to "Hold" their round score, which adds it to their global score and ends their turn.</li>
                <li>After a player holds their round score or rolls a 1, it becomes the other player's turn.</li>
                <li>The game continues until one of the players reaches or exceeds the target score.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Round Score:</strong> The score accumulated by the current player during their turn. It increases with each dice roll but resets to 0 if a 1 is rolled.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Score:</strong> The total score accumulated by a player throughout the game. It is updated when the player chooses to "Hold" their round score.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Winning the Game</h3>

            <h2>Hangman Game Rules</h2>
            <p>The Hangman game is a guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word or phrase by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.</p>

            <h3>Game Objective</h3>
            <p>The objective of the Hangman game is to correctly guess the hidden word or phrase by suggesting individual letters. The player must guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts.</p>

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>The gameplay of Hangman typically involves the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A word or phrase is selected as the secret word by one player.</li>
                <li>The secret word is represented by dashes or underscores, indicating the number of letters in the word. For example, the word "hangman" would be represented as "-------".</li>
                <li>The player(s) guess individual letters of the word, one at a time.</li>
                <li>If the guessed letter is present in the secret word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed in their correct positions. For example, if the letter 'a' is guessed in the word "hangman", the dashes would update to "--a---a-".</li>
                <li>If the guessed letter is not present in the secret word, the number of attempts is reduced, and a part of the hangman's body is drawn as a penalty. The hangman typically consists of a gallows, head, body, arms, and legs.</li>
                <li>The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:
                <ul>
                    <li>The player correctly guesses all the letters in the word, completing the word or phrase.</li>
                    <li>The player runs out of attempts, resulting in a loss.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Winning and Losing</h3>
            <p>The player wins the game by guessing all the letters in the word before running out of attempts. If the player completes the word, they are considered the winner.</p>
            <p>If the player runs out of attempts before completing the word, they lose the game.</p>

            <h3>Variations</h3>
            <p>There can be variations in the rules and gameplay of Hangman depending on the preferences of the players. Some variations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limiting the number of incorrect guesses allowed.</li>
                <li>Allowing multiple players to take turns guessing letters.</li>
                <li>Adding additional penalties to the drawing of the hangman's body.</li>
            </ul>
